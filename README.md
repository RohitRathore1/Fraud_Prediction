# Fraud_Prediction
Introduction-

In this project, we are given a dataset related to applications for a new credit card. Each record describes an application for credit card. Every credit application is characterized by following attributes;

1.ID: This is the unique identifier for a given credit application
2.dist_latest_transaction_address_km: Distance between the most recent transaction and place of application,
3.email: Email address of the applicant,
4.application_date: Application Date of the applicant,
5.site_visits_A: No. of visits to site A,
6.site_visits_B: No. of visits to site B,
7.site_visits_C: No. of visits to site C,
8.credit_limit: Credit limit of previous card,
9.number_of_transactions: Number of transactions on most recent card,
10.is_fraud: flag identifying an applicant as fraud or safe
12.The goal is to build a predictive model, which classifies a given credit application as safe or risky.
